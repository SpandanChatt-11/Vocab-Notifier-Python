```
First we try if the word has meaning and definition available in the dictionary API, if not then we break the loop and again try with a new word
if proper definition and meaning of the word is available in the dictionary API then we try if the word has an example available or not, if the example id available we send the notification with word meaning and its example (i.e use in a sentence)
if example is not available we onle send the notification with the word meaning only
